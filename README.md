# Algorithms

This repository groups the techniques for solving algorithms learned in [Codility][codility] and [HackerRank][hackerrank].

Exercises included:

- **CountCoincidences**: counts the number of coincidences in a list of numbers.
- **CountingSort**: sorts a list of numbers using the technique of counting coincidences.
- **CountTotal**: simple formula to calculate the sum of a consecutive list of numbers.
- **Fibonacci**: creates a list of numbers according to the Fibonacci sequence.
- **PrefixSums**: calculates the sum of a segment of the array using the prefix sums technique.
- **SelectionSort**: sorts a list of numbers searching for the smallest item in the array and then exchanging it for the current item.
- **Stack**: implementation of a stack using a dynamic array.
